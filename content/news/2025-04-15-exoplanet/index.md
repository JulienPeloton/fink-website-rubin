We report the discovery of an exoplanet using the microlensing effect. This event marks the first exoplanet found with Fink and is a rare example of an event observed outside the Galactic bulge.

The event was observed outside the Galactic bulge and was detected by both space-based (Gaia) and ground-based (ZTF and ASAS-SN) surveys. Fink's microlensing classification event sparked interest in the first place and then many other telescopes and surveys observed this event. From the observed data, we find that the lens system is located at a distance of approximately 1 kiloparsec and comprises an M-dwarf host star with a mass of about half that of the Sun, orbited by a Jupiter-like planet beyond the snowline. According to spectral analyses and modeling, the source star is likely a metal-poor giant located in the halo. This is a unique example of a binary-lens event outside the bulge, made possible by a disc-halo lens-source combination.

This event was hard to characterise since it was faint and the exoplanetary peak in the lightcurve occured before the main peak. With the start of LSST later this year, we hope to have many more planetary events. Note that we are also improving our microlensing classifier to better account for such cases, and to be able to trigger earlier follow-up observations to better deduce exoplanets' parameters.

This work was carried out by a large team of scientists and amateur astronomers from around the world, who conducted follow-up observations. The Fink team was led by P. Voloshyn, a student at IJCLab and the University of Paris-Saclay and Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine.
