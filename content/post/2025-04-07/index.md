We report the discovery of an exoplanet using the microlensing effect. This event is the first exoplanet found with Fink, and a rare example of event observed outside the Galactic bulge.

The event was observed outside the Galactic bulge and was alerted by both space- (Gaia) and ground-based (ZTF and ASAS-SN) surveys. From the observed data, we find that the lens system is located at a distance of âˆ¼1 kpc and comprises an M-dwarf host star of about half a solar mass, orbited by a Jupiter-like planet beyond the snowline. The source star could be a metal-poor giant located in the halo according to the spectral analyses and modelling. This is a unique example of the binary-lens event outside the bulge that is offered by a disc-halo lens-source combination.

This work was made by a large team of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world that performed follow-up observations. In Fink, the team was led by P. Voloshyn, student at IJCLab and University Paris-Saclay. More information at https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22331 (A&A, in press)
